Golang Masking Tool is a simple utility of creating a masker tool which you can use to mask sensitive information.
You can use a variety of filters with custom masking types to assist you.

Inspired by two repositories - 
1. [zlog](https://github.com/m-mizutani/zlog)
2. [Golang Masker](https://github.com/ggwhite/go-masker)

Both libraries were solving similar usecase but didn't cover all use cases I was looking for. So I combined both of them to create this library and sharing the best of both them combined. Added some more uses cases too.
